Revision history for Perl extension Data::Serializer

0.22  Fri Mar  5 16:39:36 MST 2004
	- Split up and organized test suite
	- Added support for XML::Simple
	- Created Data::Serializer::Cookbook

0.21  Tue Feb 24 16:57:19 MST 2004
	- Added support for PHP::Serializer
	- Added support for XML::Dumper
	- Added raw_serialize and raw_deserialize methods
	    allows direct access to underlying serializers
            useful to import/export data between aps that don't
	    understand Data::Serializer (like say serialized 
            PHP data)
	- Added test for serializing scalars

0.20  Fri Feb 13 17:32:02 MST 2004
	- Improved test suite to test combination of features
	- cleaned up bug in handing of 'non-portable' serialized data

0.19  Fri Feb 13 14:46:30 SDT 2004
	- Modified makefile to include dependancy on Digest::SHA1
		Thanks (again) to Florian Helmberger <fh@laudatio.com>
                  for finding this discrepancy.

0.18  Fri Feb 13 11:17:24 SDT 2004
	- Added support for MIME::Base64 for 'ascii armoring' serialized
	  data.
	- Minor modifications to pod documentation

0.17  Thu Jul 11 15:10:41 MDT 2002
	- Added support for YAML as a new serializer
		Thanks to Florian Helmberger <fhe@inode.at> for writing 
		  the relevant patch to do this.

0.16  Tue Jul  9 08:33:46 MDT 2002
	- Added support for Config::General as a new serializer
 	- Added method 'options' for passing arguments to underlying serializers
	  currently only supported for Config::General
	- Converted installation tests to use ExtUtils::Tbone (included)
	- Added more robust testing of all serializers and features
		Thanks to Thomas Linden <tom@daemon.de> who wrote a patch
	          adding support for Config::General to Data::Serializer
                  and for suggesting the addition of the options method

0.15  Mon Jul  1 13:32:46 MDT 2002
	- Correct Makefile.PL testing bug
          In particular we tested for Crypt::CBC and assumed Crypt::Blowfish
          would also be installed.  This is obviously not the case.  We do not 
          want to force this as a dependency as encryption is a feature, not a 
          requirement for serializing data structures.
	    Thanks to 'Automated Perl Test Account <perl_test@logicalchaos.org>'
              (and of course the humans behind it :-) )
