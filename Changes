Revision history for Perl extension Data::Serializer

0.16  Tue Jul  9 08:33:46 MDT 2002
	- Added support for Config::General as a new serializer
 	- Added method 'options' for passing arguments to underlying serializers
	  currently only supported for Config::General
	- Converted installation tests to use ExtUtils::Tbone (included)
	- Added more robust testing of all serializers and features

		Thanks to Thomas Linden <tom@daemon.de> who wrote a patch
	          adding support for Config::General to Data::Serializer
                  and for suggesting the addition of the options method

0.15  Mon Jul  1 13:32:46 MDT 2002
	- Correct Makefile.PL testing bug
          In particular we tested for Crypt::CBC and assumed Crypt::Blowfish
          would also be installed.  This is obviously not the case.  We do not 
          want to force this as a dependency as encryption is a feature, not a 
          requirement for serializing data structures.
          
	    Thanks to 'Automated Perl Test Account <perl_test@logicalchaos.org>'
               (and of course the humans behind it :-) )
